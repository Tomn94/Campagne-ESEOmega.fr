The RSS Image Feed adds the first image of a post to your feeds, even in firefox and even if you only display the excerpt.

== Description ==

The RSS Image Feed doesn't create a feed of images, but ataches the first image of the post to your feeds. Normally only the content has images showing. With our plugin there will be a clickable image even in the excerpt and in the content there will be only one image instead of all the images of the post. Since version 2.2 it works as a multisite plugin as well.

The plugin was tested up to WP 3.9. It should work with versions down to 2.7 but was never tested on those.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `image-rss` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin and activated it, but there are no images in my feed showing =

Try emptying the cache of your browser and reload the feed. The images should be there now.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Feed with images in Firefox
2. The Feed with images in Opera
